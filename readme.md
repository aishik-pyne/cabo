# A web based multiplayer card game called Cabo


## Rules of the game

We play with a set of **standard playing cards**, include **3 jokers**

**2-8** Players can play the game at a time.

### Setup

Everyone is dealt 4 cards, faced down.

Each choses two cards, flips them and sees what they have, and turn it face down. They only get one chance to look at it, and the player must remember them.
Note each player can see only their own cards now.
